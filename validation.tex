\section{MPLS Signatures Validation}\label{validation}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section we describe the used methodology to validate the MPLS signatures
revealed by traceroutes. Basically, we compare the LSR position within an MPLS tunnel with the different signatures values.
Implicit tunnels are based either on \textit{qTTL} or \textit{u-turn} signatures. Both of
them, directly related with MPLS position:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[i] \textit{qTTL} value refers to the IP-TTL of ICMP-\textit{echo}
  message when it enters to the MPLS  tunnel. A quoted TTL of $n$ in
  the incoming ICMP reply means that the sent probe
  expired $n$ hops later to ingress to the \textit{LSP}, i.e., a LSR reply where $\textit{qTTL}=n$ means that the LSR appears  in the $n$ position of MPLS tunnel;
  \item[ii] \textit{u-turn} value is related with the tunnel length $L$ and the $n$-position of the LSR within the tunnel (see section \ref{related.revealing}).
\end{itemize}

Our signature validation relays on the hypothesis that the MPLS position match
with the $n$-position  which an LSR is revealed by traceroute. Indeed,
we use a paris-traceroute \cite{BRICE06}  based tool in order to assure that probes follow the
same path. In order to validate our hypotheses, first, we compare a high reliable signature such as \textit{qTTL} with  $n$-position,
%
%To probe our assumption, the \textit{qTTL} values should to match with
%$n$-position,
i.e., $\textit{qTTL}=n$. 
The results are showed in figure~\ref{n_vs_qttl} while figure~\ref{hist_length} shows the MPLS tunnel length distribution; which can help us to understand the number of LSR in each $n$ position. We principally noticed that \textit{qTTL} signature highly match with $n$.%, their values are $75\%$ at least {\bf Gabriel: please check the real values}.  {GD: the details about match values are in line 45}
The bias $\textit{qTTL}=n \pm \vartriangle $ could occur due to two causes: one  is the limitation in our method to reveal the first LSRs of the
tunnel when RFC4950 is not implemented; %, i.e., the first LSR revealed by traceroute within the tunnel  ($n=1$) could correspond to a LSR with $\textit{qTTL}>n$. 
and the second cause could occur due to load balancers in the follow path. 
In the later case, the traceroute probes may follow paths with different lengths before to reach the MPLS tunnel, yielding that the same \textit{qTTL} value is revealed several times in different $n$-positions. 
The figure~\ref{n_vs_qttl} also shows that \textit{qTTL} frequently takes the value of $1$. 
This usually  means that \tpropagate is not implemented. However, we found that around $2\%$ of LSRs do not react to \textit{qTTL} signature, even if \tpropagate option is activated, i.e., some LSRs interfaces located at $i_{n\pm 1}$ tunnel positions react properly to \textit{qTTL} signatures but the LSR interface located at $i_n$ position does not.
% We think that this issue occurs because some routers update the IP-TTL to $1$ in the expired packet instead of keeping it unchanged as usual. 
However, $n$-position are highly reliable. We found that in $58\%$ of the cases the $n$-position match with the \textit{qTTL} value while in $36,3\%$ of cases the \textit{qTTL} signature is not present and takes the value of $1$, and just $6,7\%$ of the cases presented have some bias around the expected value $n$. 
This facts support our hypothesis: the  MPLS tunnel position highly match with the $n$-position  which an LSR is revealed by traceroute. 
Thereby,  we use $n$-position as a reference value to validate the \textit{u-turn} signatures.

The expected \textit{u-turn} value is related with $n$ in the way $\textit{u-turn}=2(L-(n-1))$, where $L$ is the tunnel length. 
Because \textit{u-turn} is commonly present in almost all LSRs, first, we compare $n$ vs \textit{u-turn} on LSRs  revealed either explicitly or \textit{qTTL} based.
Subsequently, we study $n$ value on LSRs where \textit{u-turn} was the only detected signature. 
We use the filter $\textit{u-turn}>3$ to avoid false positives. The results for a given tunnel length $L=5$ are showed on figures~\ref{fig_uturn_a} and~\ref{fig_uturn_b}. 
Similar results was also obtained for other tunnel length $L$ values. 
Basically, we noticed that the percentage of cases are close to expected ones when the LSRs explicitly revealed  and \textit{qTTL} is present (figure~\ref{fig_uturn_a}). 
However on the set of  LSRs revealed just by \textit{u-turn} signatures (figure \ref{fig_uturn_b}) the cases commonly  does not match. If we accept a bias of $ \pm 1$ around the expected value, we noticed that  on LSRs explicitly revealed  and \textit{qTTL} signatured based, the $60\%$ of obtained \textit{u-turn} signed cases match with the expected values. 
However, on LSRs revealed just trough \textit{u-turn} signature (therefore where it is really useful), the obtained \textit{u-turn} cases just match in $25\%$ with the expected value $2(L-(n-1))$. 
Therefore, LSRs revealed through \textit{u-turn} is highly inaccurate; % and overestimated. 
mainly because MPLS tunnels are not the only responsible on the variation in it leght, but also%  that could causes \textit{u-turn} signatures. Indeed, has been showed that 
the load balancing is common for paths between the same pairs source-destination \cite{BRICE07}. 
This issue is called \textit{per-flow} load balancing. 
Basically, packets that belongs to the same \textit{flow} are treated similarly \cite{BRICE06}. 
A \textit{flow} is identified by the first 32 bits of the IP \textit{payload}, e.g., TCP header. 
In the case of ICMP messages, this fields refers to \textit{Type}, \textit{Code} and \textit{Checksum}. 
By definition, \textit{u-turn} signature is based on two kinds of ICMP messages: ICMP \echoreply \textit{Code 11} and ICMP \ttlexceeded \textit{Code 0}. 
Due to different codes for each ICMP message, there is no way to assure that they belong to the same \textit{flow} identifier and thereby to be sure that \textit{u-turn} value is caused just by MPLS tunnels.
