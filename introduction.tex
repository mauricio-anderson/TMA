\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

Internet topology refers to the study of the various types of
connectivity structures and representations between directly connected nodes on
the Internet architecture~\cite{Calvert97}. This representation aims at
obtaining models that represent  Internet with the greatest possible accuracy in order
to test new communications protocols, algorithms, QoS policies, traffic
engineering, etc.

The Internet topology can be seen at several abstraction levels i.e., IP
interface, router, subnetwork, PoP, and Autonomous System (AS) levels. All these
models have been widely studied in the past~\cite{DONNET13} . However, the
current state of the art of Internet deployments involves a great number of
technologies impacting the Internet Topology.  And those technologies deserve a
deep study in order to include them in Internet topology models.  For instance, 
\dfn{Multiprotocol Label Switching} (MPLS)~\cite{rfc3031} has been recently the
focus of several studies~\cite{SOM11,DONNET13,Vanaubel15}.  It has been
demonstrated that MPLS is a mature technology widely deployed for (mainly) load
balancing reasons or traffic engineering purposes.  Although few studies have
partially questioned its impact on Internet topology~\cite{BRICE07,Flach2012}, the impact of MPLS deployment on the Internet architecture has not been
studied yet in deep. The importance to study new architectural details, structure and topological
features related with MPLS usage would help to know the way in
which the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use their networks or apply their
policies for traffic engineering as well as to better understand the today's
Internet architecture more accurately. Our work provides a study around the
impact of MPLS deployments over Internet Topology. Principally, we focus on the
bias involved in MPLS tunnel detection and on the features that MPLS modifies over traditional networks maps such as router level topology. For our purpose, we mainly based on  $k$-core
decomposition method~\cite{batagelj2002}. In this way, it has been shown
previously that the $k$-core decomposition is a relevant tool to describe
Internet Topology ~\cite{Alvarez06k, Serrano06, Serrano06, Alvarez08k}.

This paper adds complementary information around MPLS
usage on Internet. First, we present a quantification of the biases involved on
implicit MPLS tunnel detection. Additionally, we provided some properties and
architectural details related with MPLS deployment on router level topology. We found
that routers are commonly connected to  MPLS
networks. Finally, we found that ASes seems to have different MPLS structure 
according the type of MPLS tunnel that prevails.


The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sec.~\ref{related} provides
the state of the art and the background related to MPLS tunnels discovery. In
particular, it describes how MPLS tunnels can be revealed through active
measurements;  Sec.~\ref{dataset} explains how we collected data for this work;
Sec.~\ref{validation} presents our results related to \textit{mpls signatures}
accuracy; Sec.~\ref{cluster} presents the main contributions of this paper with
a detailed study around the behaviour of MPLS networks on the Internet Topology
and architectural details of some ASes with most MPLS usage; Finally,
Sec.~\ref{ccl} concludes this paper by summarizing its main achievements.
