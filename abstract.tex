Recently,  researches have been conducted to discover and assess the usage of
MPLS tunnels.  Indeed, recent developments in the ICMP protocol make certain
categories of MPLS tunnels transparent to \traceroute probing.  Additional
techniques have been proposed to reveal the presence of MPLS tunnels when they
do not explicitly appear in \traceroute.  It has been shown that MPLS is a very
well deployed technology whose usage (i.e., Traffic Engineering, load
balancing, etc.) varies in time and according to ASes.
However, the MPLS structure  on the Internet architecture has not been
studied yet.  In this paper, we follow this path by providing to contributions
to the state of the art: ($i$) we evaluate the biases involved on MPLS tunnel
detection when they are not directly revealed through \traceroute.  ($ii$), we
provide some properties and architectural details related with MPLS deployment
on router topology based on a $k$-core decomposition.
