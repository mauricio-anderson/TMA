\section{Conclusion}\label{ccl}

MPLS usage has an important role on Internet. Indeed, we found that MPLS
tunnels are traversed by around 34\% (explicit tunnels) and 42\% (explicit and implicit tunnels) of traceroutes probes in our dataset. In this paper, we tested the detection methods of implicit MPLS tunnels. The results suggest that although Paris traceroute works properly (avoiding per-packet load balancers) for MPLS tunnels discovery,  u-turn signatures are commonly biased due to per-flow load balancing issues in the return path. We also provided in this work a first and novel overview about MPLS structure. On one hand, our findings remarks the importance of MPLS in the Internet robustness; on the other hand we show that MPLS deployments plays an important role in the ISP's backbone.
Additionally, our methodology based on $k$-core decomposition allows us to reveal the fingerprints related with the type of MPLS tunnels that prevails for a given AS. However, we believe that it is necessary to continue the current studies adding new methods and mechanism to reveal MPLS presence. Mainly, because it is necessary to correct the u-turn biases and infer tunnels not revealed by \traceroute (invisible tunnels). Additionally, this work did not study the traffic behaviour and patterns related with MPLS presence, this information could to allow to infer LSR not revealed by the current methods.
