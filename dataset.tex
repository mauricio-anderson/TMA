In order to get MPLS data, we develop a tool called
\magallanes~\cite{magallanes}  allowing
us to easily run and manage \scamper~\cite{Luckie10} based probes through the
PlanetLab (PL) infrastructure.  \magallanes starts by randomly allocating
several vantage points (VP) within the available set of PL nodes.  It next
distributes, among those VPs, a given number of probe targets.
To achieve some geographical uniformity in target selection, \magallanes uses
data provived by IP geolocation database maxmind.\footnote{See
\url{www.maxmind.com}.  Although we know that IP geolocation databases suffer
from strong accuracy limits~\cite{geolocation}, we do not need accurate geolocation.}  In this way, it chooses the
targets randomly and proportionality distributed according to the number of
subnets assigned by the Regional Internet Registry (RIR) to each region.
Additionally, \magallanes allows one to store the experiments results on a
centralized database and to perfom alias resolution using MIDAR~\cite{Keys13}.

We ran \magallanes on October \nth{31}, 2015.  We chose 100 VPs and selected
10,000 targets per VP.  Each VP managed its own set of targets, meaning that
probes targets are disjoint sets between VPs.  \scamper was configured to run
ICMP Paris traceroute~\cite{BRICE06}.  To get the u-turn signature,
we sent a \ping to each hop revealed by Paris traceroute. We sent six
ICMP \echorequest packets from the same VP.  Six ICMP \echoreply allow us to
infer with $95\%$ confidence if there is a single return path and, 
therefore, reduce measurement errors caused by a reverse path containing
load-balanced segments of different lengths~\cite{BRICE07}. 

As a result we discovered around 270,000 IP interfaces,  520,000 links, $42\%$
of which were available to run MIDAR and we found aliases successfully on $19\%$
of then. To match IP interfaces to ASes, we used the CAIDA
dataset~\cite{caida_ref} derived from Routeviews \footnote{See
\url{www.routeviews.org}} and collected the same day as the exploration.
Additionally, we found that $44\%$ of traces collected traverse at least one
MPLS tunnel.  The amount of explicit tunnels is highly superior to implicit
ones. We discovered explicit tunnels on $34\%$ of traceroutes and at least one
implicit tunnel on $16\%$. Surprisingly, we found more implicit tunnels revealed
through u-turn signature ($12\%$) rather than qTTL signature
($4\%$). However, the qTTL signature matched with at least $63\%$ of
the explicit tunnels. We discuss these results in the next sections. Finally, we
did not found opaque tunnels, confirming so their rarity~\cite{VAN2013}.
