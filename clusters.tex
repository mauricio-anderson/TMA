To the best of our acknowledge, MPLS interconnection architecture on Internet
topology has not yet been studied. In this way, we focus our attention on
studying some LSRs properties and \dfn{MPLS clusters} \ed{BD: what's an ``MPLS
cluster''?  Please, define here in a few word the concept}; and their
interaction with non MPLS networks. Our study aims at better understanding the
impact of MPLS deployments over Internet, specifically over router level
topology.

% (Neighbor Degree Distribution) and routers with high degree usually have
% \textit{MPLS clusters} as common neighbors (Clustering Coefficient).}
\label{fig_metrics}        
\end{figure*}

We defined several graphs at different abstraction levels as follows:
% First, we obtained a portion of the IP level topology $G_{ip}$ from
% traceroutes; noticing that traceroutes reveals just a IP addresses of the
% incident routers in a path.
% Secondly, we identified the MPLS tunnels, based on the~\cte{} clasification.
% Later, we solved the alias resolution process using MIDAR and we develop a
% router level topology $G_{r}$ (from IP interfaces) and an MPLS router (LSRs)
% level topology  $G^{mpls}_{r}$ (from IP interfaces belonging to MPLS tunnels).
% Additionally,  we identified the \textit{MPLS clusters} $C^{mpls}_{i}$ and we
% treat each cluster as single node in order to study how they interacts with
% the entire router level topology $G_{r\backslash lsr}$. Finally, in order to
% better understand the MPLS behaviour  we studied this interaction for some
% ASes $G_{r\backslash lsr}(as)$.
% Following,  we define with more detail terminology used in this paper.
The \dfn{IP level graph} is defined as $G_{ip}=(V_{ip}, E_{ip})$, where $V_{ip}$
is the IP address discovered in our exploration and $E_{ip}$ is the set of the
links found trough \traceroute.   Second, the \dfn{router level graph} is
defined as $G_{r}=(V_{r}, E_{r})$, where $V_{r}$ is the set of routers in which
at least one IP address using MIDAR, and $E_{r}$ is the set of all the links
found between any pair of routers $v\in V_{r}$. Third, the \dfn{MPLS router
level graph} refers to $G^{mpls}_{r}=(V^{mpls}_{r}, E^{mpls}_{r})$
where  $V^{mpls}_{r}$ is the set of routers in which at least one routers' IP
address belongs to an LSP, and  $E^{mpls}_{r}$ is the set of all \textit{mpls
links} $(v^{mpls}_{r}(i), v^{mpls}_{r}(j))$ such as
$\{{v^{mpls}_{r}(i)},{v^{mpls}_{r}(j)} \}\in V^{mpls}_{r}$.

% \textbf{IP level Graph:} $G_{ip}=(V_{ip}, E_{ip})$, where $V_{ip}$ is the IP
% address discovered in our exploration and $E_{ip}$ is the set of the links found
% trough traceroute. Note that \traceroute just records incident IP addresses in
% a path.

   

\textbf{ASes induced Graphs:} $G_{r}(as)=(V_{r}(as), E_{r}(as))$ and
$G^{mpls}_{r}(as)=(V^{mpls}_{r}(as), E^{mpls}_{r}(as))$ are the induced graphs
of $G_{r}$ and $G^{mpls}_{r}$ respectively; such that each vertex has a router's
interface belonging to the same Autonomous System $as$.

\textbf{MPLS clusters:} $C^{mpls}_{i}$ is a connected component $i$ of
$G^{mpls}_{r}(as)$. A single AS could have several \textit{MPLS clusters}.

\textbf{MPLS cluster interconnection Graph:} $G_{r\backslash
lsr}=(V_{r\backslash lsr},E^{mpls}_{r\backslash lsr})$ is an hybrid router level
graph where all the \textit{MPLS clusters}  $C^{mpls}_{i}$ were contracted to a
single node $v\in V_{r\setminus ls}$, and non MPLS capable routers remain
unchanged. Broadly speaking, an \textit{MPLS cluster interconnection Graph}
refers to a router level graph where all \textit{MPLS clusters} are treated as a
single node. In this way, we can study how IP interfaces and non MPLS capable
routers interact with \textit{MPLS clusters}. Additionally, we called
$G_{r\backslash lsr}(as)$ to the induced subgraphs of $G_{r\backslash lsr}$ by
routers having at least one interface in the Autonomous System $as$.

As the analysis is mainly based on $k$-core decomposition, we present the
following definitions:
 
%Formally, let the graph $G=(V,E)$, $k$-core decomposition analysis is defined as:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[i]{\textbf{\textit{k}-core:}}. Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, then the
  subgraph $H=(C,E|C)$ induced by the set $ C\subseteq V$ is a \textit{k}-core
  of order $k$ $iff$ $\forall v \in C: degree_{H}(v)\geq k$ and $H$ is the
  maximum subgraph with this property.
%A \textit{k}-core of $G$ can therefore be obtained by recursively removing all
% the vertices of degree less than $k$, until all vertices in the remaining
% graph have at least degree $k$.    

  \item[ii]\textbf{Shell index}. A vertex $i$ has shell index $c$ if it belongs
  to the $c$-core but not to $(c+1)$-core. We denote by $C_i$ to the shell index
  of vertex $i$. A shell $C_c$ is composed by all the vertices whose shell index
  is $c$. The maximum value $c$ such that $C_c$ is not empty is denoted
  $C_{\max}$.  Therefore, the $k$-core is thus the union of all shells $C_c$ with
  $c \geq k$.
\end{itemize}

Finally, we use \dfn{LaNet-vi}~\cite{Alvarez06k} to get the $k$-core
decomposition. This tool returns a two dimensional plot, where the position of
each vertex depends on its shell index and on the index of its neighbors.
A color code allows for the identification of shell indices, while the vertex's
original degree is provided by its size, which depends logarithmically on the
degree. A central role in the visualization method is played by multi-components
representation of $k$-cores. In the most general situation, the recursive
removal of vertices having degree less than a given $k$ can break the original
network into various connected components, each of which might even be once
again broken by the subsequent decomposition.

In this paper, we use $k$-core decomposition focused on properties around
\textit{mpls clusters} interconnection.  \textit{LaNet-vi} is useful to read
basic features of the graph (degree, hierarchical structure, etc.) as well as
more entangled features, e.g., the relation between a vertex and the
hierarchical position of its neighbors. It is also useful to  discriminate
between networks with different topological properties and structural arrangement.
This provide us an idea about the structural arrangement and topological
properties caused by MPLS usage. Additionally, the visualization helps us to
find properties and fingerprints tightly related with MPLS presence.

  \label{fig_kcore_overview}
\end{figure*}

We analyzed the graphs $G_{ip}$ and $G_{r}$ in order to know if there is some
strong difference between their structure and properties. As was expected we
noticed that the router level topology has slightly stronger clustering
coefficient than IP level topology (see figure~\ref{fig_clustering}), due to
because the join of IP interfaces into single routers. However, the main
structure of both topologies are similar as it is displayed at
Fig.~\ref{fig_degree_distribution} and~\ref{fig_neighbor}. Because we did not
notice any meaningful difference between these topologies, and router level
topology are more approached to a realistic Internet  one, we use the last one
for the remaining of our analysis.

Fig.~\ref{fig_k_core_routers} shows the $k$-core visualization of $G_{r}$.
In the center is located the shell index with the $C_{\max}$  and the rest of
the shells are located concentrically around it. Notice that $C_{\max}$-core is
composed by several components with one having the most significant part, and it
is shown at left of the center (black nodes). On the right there is a gray scale
with each shell index $c_i$, and on the left it is a node degree scale
representing the degree in a logarithmic scale. We see that all the shells index
are highly populated and that the node degree is not related with the shell
index, i.e., there are many routers with high degree in the outer (lower)
shells.  Another typical feature of router level topology is that the links
between routers mainly occurs between routers belonging to neighbors shells,
e.g., the routers on the outer shells are not usually connected to the routers
located on the  $C_{\max}$-core, as it is in the Autonomous Systems
maps~\cite{Alvarez06k}.

In order to locate LSRs-routers with MPLS capabilities into the shells index
over $k$-core decomposition, we painted in black the \textit{non MPLS capable
routers} and in gray color the LSRs. The results are showed in
Fig.~\ref{fig_k_core_LSR}.  For the sake of the visualization we do not include
neither the shell index, degree scale nor edges between shells. We noticed that
the LSRs are commonly distributed around the different shells of Internet but
lightly tends to concentrate with more density nearby to the $C_{\max}$-core.
Additionally, we apply the same methodology for the MPLS interconnection cluster
level graph $G_{r\backslash lsr}$: \textit{MPLS clusters} (gray nodes) are
distinguished from the non MPLS capable routers (black nodes), presented at
Fig.~\ref{fig_k_core_MPLS}. In this case,  \textit{MPLS clusters}  are also
spread out on the Internet, indeed we see some well defined gray nodes on the
periphery of the decomposition. However \textit{MPLS clusters} shows a stronger
tendency to concentrate it near to the $C_{\max}$-core.

Finally, we evaluated the impact of \textit{MPLS clusters} on the typical router
level topology, i.e., \textit{MPLS cluster interconnection graph} $G_{r
\backslash lsr }$. We use metrics such as degree distribution, clustering
coefficient, and nearest neighbor degree, as is shown on Fig.~\ref{fig_metrics}.
We noticed that \textit{MPLS clusters} highly impact over the router level
topology. On one hand, the nearest neighbor degree highly increments for low
degrees nodes on $G_{r \backslash lsr }$, suggesting that routers with low
degree are highly connected to \textit{MPLS clusters} and thereby to LSRs.
On the other hand, the clustering coefficient of $G_{r \backslash lsr }$ change
significantly their slope in regards with IP and router level topology,
indicating that routers with high degree are connected to \textit{common}
\textit{MPLS clusters}.

\subsection{\textit{MPLS clusters} on Autonomous Systems}\label{cluster.as}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Although, the previous results give us a general overview about MPLS deployment,
we believe that the study of MPLS structure requires some deep into the
individual AS topology. Indeed, we found that around $89.9\%$ of \textit{mpls
links} are intra-AS. Thereby, we choose the top of ASes according to the total
number of discovered links; and in order to focus our analysis on those ASes
were MPLS is relevant, we discarded those having less than five hundred
\textit{mpls links}. Additionally, we identified  the amount of \textit{mpls
links} by AS, distinguishing the type of tunnel:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[i] \textit{explicit mpls link:} Link between an interface
  $i^{\text{explicitMPLS}}_{n}$  and its immediate previous interface
  $i^{\text{MPLS}}_{n-1}$ discovered by traceroute, such that
  $i^{\text{explicitMPLS}}_{n}$ belongs to an explicit MPLS tunnel and
  $i^{\text{MPLS}}_{n-1}$ belongs to any kind of MPLS tunnel (explicit,
  \textit{qTTL} based or \textit{u-turn} based).
  \item[ii] \textit{qTTL mpls link:} Link between the interfaces
  $i^{\text{qTTL}}_{n}$  and $i^{\text{MPLS}}_{n-1}$, such that
  $i^{\text{qTTL}}_{n}$ belongs to a tunnel \textit{qTTL} based.
  \item[iii] \textit{u-turn mpls link:} Link between the interfaces
  $i^{\text{u-turn}}_{n}$  and $i^{\text{MPLS}}_{n-1}$, such that
  $i^{\text{u-turn}}_{n}$ belongs to a tunnel \textit{u-turn} based.
\end{itemize}

The summary of the top ASes is showed in the Fig.~\ref{top_as}.
We noticed that the ratio $r_{mpls}= \vert E^{mpls}_{r} (as) \vert /\vert E_{r}
(as) \vert $  is greater when more  \textit{explicit mpls links} have been
discovered. Interestingly, we also see that the ASes with more links discovered
have the lowest ratio $r_{mpls}$.

For our purposes, we select the most representatives ASes from those in
Fig.~\ref{top_as}. In this way we analyzed the graphs $G_{r}(as)$ and
$G_{r\backslash lsr}(as)$ for AS1299, AS174, AS6762, AS7018, AS1273 and AS2914.
The most remarkable observation (see Fig.~\ref{fig_cluster_mpls}) occurs
regarding the graph $G_{r\backslash lsr}(as)$: $k$-core decomposition highly
differs on those ASes, where prevails explicit tunnels in regard to those with
more \textit{u-turn} tunnels proportionally .We show that \textit{MPLS clusters}
(represented as gray nodes) for  AS1299 (Teliasonera AB), AS174 (Cogent
Communication) and AS6762 (Telecom Italia) are spread out over different shells
index. These $k$-core structures are similar in our top four of ASes where we
additionally noticed  the \textit{u-turn} signature was majority discovered,
i.e., between $30\%$ and  $80\%$ over  the total amount of \textit{mpls links}.
However, for AS7018 (AT\&T), AS1273 (Cable and Wireless Worldwide plc) and
AS2914 (NTT America Inc.)  where prevail explicit tunnels, we found a $k$-core
structure highly different. In these cases,  the ASes have few and well defined
\textit{MPLS clusters}, mainly belonging to the $C_{\max}$-core.
The same $k$-core decomposition structure was noticed  on the rest of top ASes
with high percentage of \textit{qTTL} signature, i.e., AS7018, AS1273 and
AS2914.

Another remarkable observation  relays on the fact that the maximum degree
reached by \textit{MPLS clusters} is considerably high in regard to the network
size. Indeed, with exception of AS174, the rest of ASes suggest that more than
$50\%$ of non mpls routers are connected  to at least one LSR. Actually, even
the outer shells of the $k$-core decomposition are linked directly with the
\textit{MPLS clusters} located in the $C_{\max}$-core. This behavior match with
our observation of nearest neighbor degree and clustering coefficient noticed on
Sec.~\ref{cluster.topo}. Additionally, because \textit{MPLS clusters} are
mainly located on $C_{\max}$-core (even on the ASes with high percentage of
\textit{u-turn mpls links}), we believe that MPLS plays an important role in the
backbone of the ISPs.

Summarizing, we observed that  $k$-core decomposition structure varies according
the type of MPLS tunnels that prevails in the AS. This observation could suggest
that exists a great number of MPLS links non revealed by \traceroute in the ASes
where prevail \textit{u-turn} signatures; therefore, the LSRs discovered can not
build large \textit{MPLS clusters} so they are thoroughly spread out.
Additionally, because \textit{u-turn} signatures are inaccurate, as we showed
previously, there could exists several false LSRs spread out over the shell
indexes, adding false \textit{MPLS clusters}. Finally, it draws our attention
that the ratio of \textit{u-turn links} differs greatly just on ASes with low
$r_{mpls}$, producing a \textit{u-turn} bias in some ASes while not in others,
yielding inaccuracies to topology.
