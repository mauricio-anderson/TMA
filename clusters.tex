\section{LSRs and MPLS clusters}\label{cluster}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This section aims at better
understanding the impact of MPLS deployments over Internet, specifically over
router level topology. To achieve our purpose, we study how LSRs and \dfn{MPLS clusters} 
interacts  with non MPLS routers. Generally speaking, we compare the fingerprints  on $k$-core 
decomposition that MPLS presence causes over the Internet Topology. We propose two main studies: the
first one related to locate the LSRs and MPLS clusters over the entire router topology; and a second
one related to understand the MPLS structure for a given AS.

We defined several graphs at different abstraction levels as follows (The main are
summarized in Table~\ref{cluster.table_notations}): First, the \dfn{IP level graph} $G_{ip}$, built
by the IP addresses and links found trough
\traceroute. Second, the \dfn{router level graph} $G_{r}$, getting after solve alias resolution process
through MIDAR~\cite{Keys13}). Third, the \dfn{MPLS router level
graph} $G^{mpls}_{r}$, formed by MPLS links and routers in which at least one IP interface belongs
to an LSP.

The \dfn{ASes induced graph} $G_{r}(as)$ is a subgraph of $G_{r}$ where 
each vertex  has an interface belonging to the same Autonomous System, namely $as$. 
In particular, the induced graph of $G_r^{mpls}$ is
$G^{mpls}_{r}(as)$.  Considering a connected component $C^{mpls}_{i}$ in a $G^{mpls}_{r}(as)$, it is called  \dfn{MPLS cluster}. Finally, the \dfn{MPLS cluster interconnection graph} is an hybrid router level graph,  $G_{r\backslash lsr}$,
where all the MPLS clusters $C^{mpls}_{i}$ are gathered together in a single
node, while non-MPLS capable routers remain unchanged.
Broadly speaking, an MPLS cluster interconnection graph refers to a router level
graph where all MPLS clusters are treated as a single node. Additionally,
we call $G_{r\backslash lsr}(as)$ to the induced
subgraphs of $G_{r\backslash lsr}$ by routers having at least one interface in
the Autonomous System $as$.

This work,  principally focused on MPLS
clusters interconnection graph $G_{r\backslash lsr}$ and their respective ASes induced graphs $G_{r\backslash lsr}(as)$. In this way, we study how MPLS clusters are connected 
to non-MPLS capable routers. Particularly, as MPLS clusters interconnection graph analysis is mainly based on $k$-core decomposition,
we  present the following definitions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item\dfn{\textit{k}-core:} Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, then the
  subgraph $H=(C,E|C)$ induced by the set $ C\subseteq V$ is a \textit{k}-core
  of order $k$ $iff$ $\forall v \in C: degree_{H}(v)\geq k$ and $H$ is the
  maximum subgraph with this property.
      
  \item\dfn{Shell index}. A vertex $i$ has a shell index $c$ if it
  belongs to the $c$-core but not to $(c+1)$-core. We denote by $C_i$ the shell
  index of vertex $i$. A shell $C_c$ consists of all the vertices whose shell
  index is $c$. The maximum value $c$ such that $C_c$ is not empty is denoted by
  $C_{\max}$.  Therefore, the $k$-core is thus the union of all shells $C_c$ with
  $c \geq k$.
\end{itemize}

To retrieve the $k$-core decomposition of a graph $G$, we use
\lanet\cite{Alvarez06k}.  
This tool returns a two dimensional plot, where the position of each vertex is arranged into a circle
depending on its shell index and its neighbors' index. A color code allows for the identification of shell indices, and diameter of the spheres represent vertex's degree in a logarithmic scale. 
The $k$-core decomposition can break the original network into various connected components which are displayed as independent circles.

\subsection{MPLS on Internet Topology}\label{cluster.topo}

  \caption{$k$-core visualization of router level topology $G_{r}$.}
  \label{fig_k_core_routers}
\end{figure}

In this section we study the LSRs and MPLS cluster structure over
the Internet Topology.  First, we selected the router level topology
for our analysis because it is closer to a realistic Internet one and
because  we did not notice any strong difference between IP and router level topology
as Fig.~\ref{fig_metrics} suggests. Indeed, we just noticed that router level topology has slightly stronger clustering coefficient (see Fig.~\ref{fig_clustering}), due to alias resolution process.
In this way, Fig.~\ref{fig_k_core_routers} shows the $k$-core visualization of $G_{r}$.  The
figure is divided in three parts, the main part being in the upper left while
the two others are a zoom on the main part.  The main part is composed of two
scales, the one on the left is the node degree scale representing the degree in
a logarithmic scale, while the one on the right is a gray scale with each shell
index $c_i$. Between the two scales, we see the shell index with $C_{\max}$ in
the center, the other shells being located concentrically around it. Notice that the
$\text{Degree}_{\max}=9732$ correspond to a isolated interface (IP private address) maybe belonging to a
big layer 2 network. The real $\text{Degree}_{\max}$ value is around $749$. Additional, note that
$C_{\max}$-core is made of several components with one having the most
significant part, and it is shown at the left of the center (black nodes).  We
also see that all the shells index are highly populated and that the node degree
is not related with the shell index, i.e., there are many routers with high
degree in the outer (lower) shells.  Another typical feature of router level
topology is that the links between routers mainly occurs between routers
belonging to neighbors shells, e.g., the routers on the outer shells are not
usually connected to the routers located on the  $C_{\max}$-core, as it is in
the Autonomous Systems maps~\cite{Alvarez06k}.

  gray nodes refer to LSRs.  On Fig.~\ref{fig_k_core_MPLS}, black nodes refer to
  non MPLS capable routers and gray nodes refer to MPLS clusters.} 
  \label{fig_kcore_overview}
\end{figure*}

In order to locate LSRs-routers with MPLS capabilities into the shells index
over $k$-core decomposition, we paint in black the non-MPLS routers and in gray
the LSRs. The results are showed in Fig.~\ref{fig_k_core_LSR}.  For the sake of
the visualization, we do not include neither the shell index, degree scale, nor
edges between shells. 
We notice that the LSRs are commonly distributed around
the different shells of Internet, with slightly low density in the lower shells.   
Additionally, we apply the same methodology
for the MPLS interconnection cluster level graph $G_{r\backslash lsr}$
(Fig.~\ref{fig_k_core_MPLS}): MPLS clusters (gray nodes) are distinguished from
the non-MPLS capable routers (black nodes). 
In this case,  MPLS clusters  degree is correlated with shell index: as higher is shell cluster then higher is its degree. This behavior is observed in hierarchical networks, e.g., the Autonomous System network. 


Finally, we evaluate $G_{r \backslash lsr }$ using metrics such as degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and nearest
neighbor degree, as is shown on Fig.~\ref{fig_metrics}.
We notice that MPLS clusters highly impact over the router level topology. On
one hand, the nearest neighbor degree highly increments for low degrees nodes on
$G_{r \backslash lsr}$, suggesting that routers with low degree are highly
connected to MPLS clusters and thereby to LSRs. Notice that vertices with high degree are principally the MPLS clusters, as Fig.~\ref{fig_k_core_MPLS} shows.
On the other hand, the clustering coefficient of $G_{r \backslash lsr }$ is highly increased for vertices having degree $50$ to $200$. This suggests that MPLS deployments plays an important role on Internet robustness, i.e., local robustness of the network increase because there exists different paths joining every pair of close vertices (higher clustering means more triangles in the network).

\subsection{MPLS clusters on Autonomous Systems}\label{cluster.as}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Although, the previous results give us a general overview about MPLS deployment,
we believe that the study of MPLS structure requires to go deeper into the
individual AS topology. Indeed, we found that around $89.9\%$ of MPLS links are intra-domain. Thereby, we focus on the top ASes in terms of total
number of discovered links.  On this set of ASes, we discard those having less
than 500 MPLS links. Additionally, we identify the amount of discovered MPLS
links by AS, distinguishing the type of MPLS tunnel to their belong, i.e., given
a link between two MPLS interfaces $i_{n-1}$  and $i_{n}$ discovered by 
traceroute at $n-1$ and $n$ position, we called:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[i] \dfn{explicit MPLS link:} links 
  where $i_{n}$ belongs  to an explicit MPLS tunnel.
  \item[ii] \dfn{qTTL MPLS link:} links 
  where $i_{n}$ belongs  to an implicit MPLS tunnel qTTL based.
  \item[iii] \dfn{u-turn MPLS link:} links 
  where $i_{n}$ belongs  to an implicit MPLS tunnel u-turn based.
\end{itemize}

The summary of the top ASes is showed in the Fig.~\ref{top_as}.
We noticed that the ratio $r_{mpls}= \vert E^{mpls}_{r} (as) \vert /\vert E_{r}
(as) \vert $  is greater when more  explicit MPLS links have been
discovered. Interestingly, we also see that the ASes with more ip links discovered
have the lowest ratio $r_{mpls}$. For our purposes, we select the most representatives ASes from those in Fig.~\ref{top_as}. In this way, we analyzed the graphs $G_{r}(as)$ and
$G_{r\backslash lsr}(as)$ for AS1299, AS174, AS6762, AS2914, AS7018 and AS1273 (see Fig.~\ref{fig_cluster_mpls}). We noticed that $k$-core decomposition
differs on those ASes, where prevails explicit MPLS links in regard to those with more u-turn MPLS links. Particularly, we show that MPLS clusters
(represented as gray nodes) for  AS1299 (Teliasonera AB), AS174 (Cogent
Communication) and AS6762 (Telecom Italia) are spread out over different shells, showing that do not
exist a predominant MPLS cluster.
These $k$-core structures are similar in our top five of ASes where u-turn signature was majority discovered, i.e., between $30\%$ and  $80\%$ over  the total amount of MPLS links.

However, for  AS2914 (NTT America Inc.), AS7018 (AT\&T) and AS1273 (Cable and
Wireless Worldwide plc) where prevail explicit MPLS links, we found a $k$-core
structure highly different, i.e., Most of vertices are directly connect to a predominant MPLS cluster
located at $C_{\max}$-core.
The remain of  ASes in Fig.~\ref{top_as} with high percentage of explicit tunnels have the same behavior.

Another remarkable observation  relays on the fact that the maximum degree
reached by MPLS clusters is considerably high in regard to the network
size. Indeed, with exception of AS174, the rest of ASes suggest that more than
$50\%$ of non-MPLS routers are connected  to at least one LSR. Actually, even
the outer shells of the $k$-core decomposition are linked directly with the
MPLS clusters located in the $C_{\max}$-core. This behavior match with
our observation of nearest neighbor degree and clustering coefficient noticed on
Sec.~\ref{cluster.topo}. Additionally, because MPLS clusters are
mainly located on $C_{\max}$-core (even on the ASes with high percentage of
u-turn MPLS links), we believe that MPLS plays an important role in the
backbone of the ISPs.

Summarizing, we observed that  $k$-core decomposition structure varies according
the type of MPLS tunnels that prevails in the AS. Mainly, we showed that ASes where prevails 
explicit MPLS links have a common $k$-core structure that highly differ from those ASes with
high presence of u-turn MPLS links. We believe that the $k$-core decomposition  on the top five ASes could have different structure due to either  the
u-turn signature inaccuracy or due to some particular MPLS deployment. Indeed, we noticed only on these
ASes a low ratio $r_{mpls}$ and an unusual  high presence of  u-turn links.
