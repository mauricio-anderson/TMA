For the best of our acknowledge, MPLS interconnection architecture on Internet Topology has not
been yet studied. In this way, in this section we focus our attention on study some properties
of LSRs and \textit{MPLS clusters}; and their interaction with non MPLS networks. Our study aims to better understand the impact of MPLS deployments over internet, specifically over router level topology.

Clusterin Coeficient and Neighbor Degree Distribution do not change significantly between IP level and router level topologies. However the \textit{MPLS clusters} presence highly impact on internet topology. The figure suggest that routers with low degree are highly connected with LSRs (Neighbor Degree Distribution) and routers with high degree ussually have \textit{MPLS clusters} as common neighbors (Clusterin Coeficient).} \label{fig_metrics}
\end{figure*}

We defined several graphs at many abstraction levels. First, we make an IP level topology $G_{ip}$ from traceroutes. Secondly, we identified the MPLS tunnels. Later, we solved the alias resolution process using MIDAR and we develop a router level topology $G_{r}$ (from IP interfaces) and an MPLS router (LSRs) level topology  $G^{mpls}_{r}$ (from IP interfaces belonging to MPLS tunnels). Additionally,  we identified the \textit{MPLS clusters} $C^{mpls}_{i}$ and we treat each cluster as single node in order to study how they interacts with the entire router level topology $G_{r\backslash lsr}$. Finally, in order to better understand the MPLS behaviour  we studied this interaction for some ASes $G_{r\backslash lsr}(as)$.

Following,  we define with more detail terminology used in this paper. 

\textbf{IP level Graph:} $G_{ip}=(V_{ip}, E_{ip})$, where
$V_{ip}$ is the IP address discovered in our exploration and $E_{ip}$ is the set
of the links found trough traceroute.

\textbf{Router Level Graph:} $G_{r}=(V_{r}, E_{r})$, where $V_{r}$ is the set of routers where we found
at least one IP address through MIDAR and $E_{r}$ is the set of all the links found between
any pair of routers.

\textbf{MPLS router level Graph:} $G^{mpls}_{r}=(V^{mpls}_{r},
E^{mpls}_{r})$ where  $V^{mpls}_{r}$ is the set of routers where we found
at least one IP address belonging to an MPLS tunnel and  $E^{mpls}_{r}$ is the
set of all \textit{mpls links} $(v^{mpls}_{r}(i), v^{mpls}_{r}(j))$ such as
$v^{mpls}_{r}(i)$ and  $v^{mpls}_{r}(j)$  $\in V^{mpls}_{r}$.

\textbf{ASes induced Graphs:} $G_{r}(as)=(V_{r}(as), E_{r}(as))$ and $G^{mpls}_{r}(as)=(V^{mpls}_{r}(as),
E^{mpls}_{r}(as))$ are the induced graphs of $G_{r}$ and $G^{mpls}_{r}$
respectively, such as each  vertex has a router's interface belonging to the same Autonomous System $as$.

\textbf{MPLS clusters:} $C^{mpls}_{i}$ is a
connected component $i$ of $G^{mpls}_{r}(as)$. One AS could to have
several \textit{MPLS clusters}.    

\textbf{MPLS cluster interconnection Graph:} $G_{r\backslash lsr}=(V_{r\backslash lsr},
E^{mpls}_{r\backslash lsr})$ is an hybrid router level graph where all the \textit{MPLS clusters}  $C^{mpls}_{i}$ were contracted to a
single node while non MPLS capable routers remains unchanged. Broadly
speaking, an \textit{MPLS cluster interconnection Graph} refers to a router level graph where all \textit{MPLS clusters} are treated as a single node. In this way, we can study how IP
interfaces and non MPLS capable routers interact with \textit{MPLS clusters}. Additionally , we
called $G_{r\backslash lsr}(as)$ to the induced
subgraphs of $G_{r\backslash lsr}$  such
as each vertex  has a router's interface belonging to the same Autonomous System $as$.


Our analysis is mainly based on $k$-core decomposition. This is a tool where we can easily read basic features of the graph (degree, hierarchical structure, etc.) as well as more entangled features, e.g., the relation between a vertex and the hierarchical position of its neighbours. It is also useful to  discriminate between networks with different topological properties and structural arrangement. 

Formally, let the graph $G=(V,E)$, $k$-core decomposition analysis is defined as:

\begin{itemize}
\item[i]{\textbf{\textit{k}-cores}}. A subgraph $H=(C,E|C)$ induced by the set $ C\subseteq V$ is a \textit{k}-core of order $k$ $iff$ $\forall v \in C: degree_{H}(v)\geq k$ and $H$ is the maximum subgraph with this property.

A \textit{k}-core of $G$ can therefore be obtained by recursively removing all the vertices of degree less than $k$, until all vertices in the remaining graph have at least degree $k$. 

\item[ii]\textbf{Shell index}. A vertex $i$ has shell index $c$ if it belongs to the $c$-core but not to $(c+1)$-core. We denote by $C_i$ to the shell index of vertex $i$. A shell $C_c$ is composed by all the vertices whose shell index is $c$. The maximum value $c$ such that $C_c$ is not empty is denoted $C_{\max}$. The $k$-core is thus the union of all shells $C_c$ with $c \geq k$.

\end{itemize}

Finally, we use  \textit{LaNet-vi} \cite{Alvarez06k} to get the $k$-core decomposition. \textit{LaNet-vi} returns a two dimensional plot, where the position of each vertex depends on its shell index and on the index of its neighbours. A color code allows for the identification of shell indices, while the vertex's original degree is provided by its size that depends logarithmically on the degree. A central role in the visualization method is played by multi-components representation of $k$-cores. In the most general situation, indeed, the recursive removal of vertices having degree less than a given $k$ can break the original network into various connected components, each of which might even be once again broken by the subsequent decomposition.

In this paper, we use $k$-core decomposition focused on properties around \textit{mpls clusters} interconnection. This provide us an idea about the structural arrangement and topological properties caused by MPLS usage. Additionally,  the visualization help us to find properties and fingerprints tightly related with MPLS presence.

\label{fig_kcore_overview}
\end{figure*}

First, we analysed the graphs $G_{ip}$ and $G_{r}$ in order to know if there is
some strong difference between their structure and properties. As was expected
we noticed that the router level topology has slightly stronger clustering coefficient than
IP level topology (see \ref{fig_clustering}). This fact occurs due to the join of IP interfaces into single
routers. However, the main structure of both topologies are similar. Because we did not
notice any meaningful difference between this topologies, and because router level topology
are more approached to a realistic Internet behaviour, we choose it to the remain of our analysis.

Figure \ref{fig_k_core_routers} shows the $k$-core visualization of $G_{r}$. In
the center is located the shell index with the $C_{\max}$  and the rest of
the shells are located concentrically around it. On the right there is a gray scale
with each shell index $c_i$ and left is a node degree scale represented by the
size of each one. We see that all the shells index are highly populated and that
the node degree is not related with the shell index i.e., there is many routers
with high degree in the outer shells. Another typical feature of router level topology is that the links between routers mainly occurs between routers belonging to neighbours shells, e.g., the routers on the outer shells are not usually connected to the routers located on the top core. 


In order to locate LSRs-routers
with MPLS capabilities into the shells index over $k$-core decomposition, we painted in black the 
\textit{non MPLS capable routers} and in gray color the LSRs. The
results are showed in figure \ref{fig_k_core_LSR}. For the sake of the
visualization we do not include neither the shell index, degree scale nor edges between shells. We noticed
that the LSRs are commonly distributed around the different shells of Internet
but  lightly tends to concentrate with more density nearby to the core.
Additionally, we apply the same methodology for the MPLS interconnection cluster level graph
$G_{r\backslash lsr}$: \textit{MPLS clusters} (gray nodes) are distinguished from the non MPLS capable routers (black nodes). The figure \ref{fig_k_core_MPLS} shows the
results. In this case,  \textit{MPLS clusters}  are also spread out on the Internet, indeed we see some well defined gray nodes on the periphery of the decomposition. However \textit{MPLS clusters} shows a stronger tendency to
concentrate it near to the core. Finally, we evaluated the impact of \textit{MPLS clusters} on the typical router level topology i.e., \textit{MPLS cluster interconnection graph} $G_{r \backslash lsr }$. We use metrics such as degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and nearest neighbour degree. The results are showed on figure \ref{fig_metrics}. We noticed that \textit{MPLS clusters} highly impact over the router level topology. The nearest neighbour degree highly increments for low degrees nodes on $G_{r \backslash lsr }$. This suggest that routers with low degree are highly connected to \textit{MPLS clusters} and thereby to LSRs. On the other hand, the clustering coefficient of $G_{r \backslash lsr }$ change significantly their slope in regards with IP and router level topology. This suggest that routers with high degree are connected to \textit{common} \textit{MPLS clusters}.


\subsection{\textit{MPLS clusters} on Autonomous Systems}\label{cluster.as}

Although, the previous results give us a general overview about MPLS deployment,
we believe that the study of MPLS structure requires a zoom in on each AS. Indeed, we found that around
$89.9\%$ of \textit{mpls links} are intra-AS.  Thereby, we choose the top of ASes according to the amount of  links discovered. In order to focus our analysis on those ASes were MPLS is relevant, we discard those where we found less than five hundred of \textit{mpls links}. Additionally, we identified  the amount of \textit{mpls links} by AS distinguishing the type of tunnel, e.g., we define as \textit{explicit mpls link} to those link between an interface $i_{n}$ revealed as explicitly MPLS capable and its previous interface $i_{n-1}$ discovered by traceroute, provided that $i_{n-1}$ was also revealed as MPLS interface. In the same way for \textit{qTTL} and  \textit{u-turn mpls links}.

The summary of the top ASes is showed in the figure \ref{top_as}. We noticed that the
ratio $r_{mpls}= \vert E^{mpls}_{r} (as) \vert /\vert E_{r} (as) \vert $  is greater when more  \textit{explicit mpls links} have
been discovered. Interestingly, we also see that the ASes with more
links discovered have the lowest ratio $r_{mpls}$. 

For our purposes, we select the most representatives ASes from our top. In this way we analysed the graphs $G_{r}(as)$ and $G_{r\backslash lsr}(as)$ for AS1299, AS174, AS6762, AS7018, AS1273 and AS2910. The most remarkable
observation occurs regarding the graph $G_{r\backslash lsr}(as)$: $k$-core decomposition highly differs on those ASes where prevails explicit tunnels in regard to those where prevails \textit{u-turn} tunnels. The figure \ref{fig_cluster_mpls} show this observation.  We show that \textit{MPLS clusters} (represented as gray nodes) for  AS1299 (Teliasonera AB), AS174 (Congent Communication) and AS6762 (Telecom Italia) are spread out over different shells index. This $k$-core structure are similar in our top four of ASes where we additionally noticed  the \textit{u-turn} signature was majority discovered i.e., between $30\%$ and  $80\%$ over  the total amount of \textit{mpls links}. However, for AS7018 (AT\&T), AS1273 (Cable and Wireless Worldwide plc) and AS2910 (Citicorp) where prevail explicit tunnels, we found a $k$-core
structure highly different.  In these cases,  the ASes have few
and well defined \textit{MPLS clusters}, mainly belonging to the top core $C_{\max}$. The same $k$-core decomposition structure was noticed  on the rest of top ASes with high percentage of \textit{qTTL} signature. 

Another remarkable observation  relays on the fact that the maximum degree reached by \textit{MPLS clusters} is considerably high in regard to the network size. Indeed, with exception of AS174, the rest of
ASes suggest that more than $50\%$ of non mpls routers are connected  to at
least one LSR. Actually, even the outer shells of the $k$-core decomposition are
linked directly with the \textit{MPLS clusters} located in the top core. This behaviour match with our observation of nearest neighbour degree and clustering coefficient noticed on section \ref{cluster.topo}. Additionally, because \textit{MPLS clusters} are mainly located on top core of the $k$-core decomposition (even on the ASes with high percentage of \textit{u-turn mpls links}), we believe that MPLS plays an important role in the backbone of the ISPs.

Summarizing, we observed that  $k$-core decomposition structure varies according the type of MPLS tunnels that prevails in the AS. This observation could suggest that exists a great number of MPLS links non revealed by traceroute in ye ASes where prevails \textit{u-turn} signatures, therefore, 
the LSRs discovered can not build large \textit{MPLS clusters} so they
are thoroughly spread out. Additionally, because \textit{u-turn} signatures are
overestimated, as we showed previously, there could exists several false LSRs
spread out over the shell indexes, adding false \textit{MPLS clusters}. Finally, it draws our attention that the ratio of \textit{u-turn links} differs greatly just on ASes with low $r_{mpls}$. The issues that produces theses \textit{u-turn} bias in some ASes and not in others are not clearly at all.
